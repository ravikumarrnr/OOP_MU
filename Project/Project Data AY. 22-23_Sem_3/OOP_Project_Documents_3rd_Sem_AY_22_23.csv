It is a very long process. First to buy the newspaper and then to go through every page of the paper. If someone is looking for some specific sector news, then it got tough for them to get the news directly.

 The main objective behind developing this Online News portal project in Java is to provide a system for the news agencies where they can share the everyday news to their customers.

 Previously built Weather Report project web based application was compatible with system and every time users start this application, they have to set their default location to get weather reports on it. Due to complex coding, system responding time was high and require more memory to get start up. The concept of graphics for geographical region was not implemented in older version. Dynamic concept was not implemented under the existing system, thus theme and color of web page was not changing as per the weather report.

This task if carried out manually will be tedious and includes chances of mistakes. These errors are avoided by allowing the system to keep track of information such as issue date, last date to return the book and even fine information and thus there is no need to keep manual track of this information which thereby avoids chances of mistakes.
Thus, this system reduces manual work to a great extent allows smooth flow of library activities by removing chances of errors in the details.

It has been able to successfully implement a wide variety of currencies from across the globe to exchange. With the current population travelling from country to country, this system has seen widespread use and is now considered a bare necessity. Most of these services can be seen at airports, due to such importance in modern lifestyle.
Each country determines the exchange rate regime that will apply to its currency. For example, a currency may be floating, pegged (fixed), or a hybrid. Governments can impose certain limits and controls on exchange rates. Countries can also have a strong or weak currency. There is no agreement in the economic literature on the optimal national exchange rate (unlike on the subject of trade where free trade is considered optimal).[2] Rather, national exchange rate regimes reflect political considerations.
Ever since the currency exchange services had boomed over the years, it is important that we try to always improve on the craft and weed out any new and existing errors. As long as money is widely used, such services would always be on top due to their sheer importance.","Min Myat Thi Ha","92100103163","minmyat.thiha114199@marwadiuniversity.ac.in","TC6","Myat Kyaw Htun","92100103420","Ye Mann Hein","92100103423","3","https://drive.google.com/u/1/open?usp=forms_web&id=1rQNQjZhS7gp54bH5zguiY0JL5eb14RXW","https://drive.google.com/u/1/open?usp=forms_web&id=1e0ORcv_8lvS8aiwvmK-VpbZ-rb61KrcT","https://drive.google.com/u/1/open?usp=forms_web&id=1KR1SCX6OXwU1_DFf2onHKXJtzJp77YKV",""

Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
Why do we use it?

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

Where does it come from?

Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, ""Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.."", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from ""de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum"" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

The billing information on telecom bills needs to be given in an understandable manner and should be properly organised. Avoiding needless complication, being direct, and being clear-cut are all requirements for this information. When information is arranged in parts and categories, it must be presented logically and detailed so that the client can quickly grasp its meaning and context. Most essential, billing information must be detailed enough for clients to confidently determine that the services they have ordered and the ones they are being charged for. In other words, each charge must be for a specific service or goal that is listed on the statement.
Every bill must include information that clearly identifies the client in order to guarantee that customers can quickly confirm that the bill they have received corresponds to the services they have subscribed to. The customer's name, customer number, account number, and email or postal address should be at the very least included in this data.
As admins  they have their own Dos and Don’ts  to be performed.  They can create new account for customers and also they can do any changes or updates but they can not log in as customer or they cannot knew the customers account number and also they cannot not make any update related to money in customers account. Account number should be generated automatically when customer creates new account.

In this system, the lecturer can verify the results of the automatic attendance made by the system. On the basis of student's presence in the class, the attendance will be generated by the system. The face of the student is recognized and it saves the response in database automatically by the system. We have to add a camera scanner for face identification. We can put the time duration and present or absent button beside all student’s name. it can make work easier and more efficient for faculties. This verification process is needed because the face recognition process carried out by the system cannot reach 100% accuracy.","Devanshi Jatinkumar Jasani","92210103021","devanshi.jasani118092@marwadiuniversity.ac.in","TC3","Anshi Pravinbhai Rank","92210103086","Deep Kiritbhai Kaneriya","92210103032","3","https://drive.google.com/u/1/open?usp=forms_web&id=1Tuy-kx0z77fRqjhF4rZsAXtZqUtkZeSC","https://drive.google.com/u/1/open?usp=forms_web&id=1_tyahn6DmPJmUeyMQUqIx1t0Os-FQKUY","https://drive.google.com/u/1/open?usp=forms_web&id=1ezPV3rwk4W6NH0QGcVculI_iJDxb0IbO","https://drive.google.com/u/1/open?usp=forms_web&id=1Z-2BmP3KVxYgmXiveJZ_5xrw4I4KI9ZI"

Error exceptions 
Exception Handling
Inheritance.
GUI Implementation using jframe form.
Database connectivity 

The existing system only has three functionalities, which are adding a new book for 
buying, searching a book & showing the database search result. 
It is only supported for java programming language .
There is no system for modifying the existing added book.

Using this system you can lookup for and add any number of books you want.

Hostels without a management system are usually done manually. Registration forms verification to other data saving processes are done manually and most at times, they are written on paper. Thus a lot of repetitions can be avoided with an automated system.

The drawbacks of existing systems lead to the design of a computerised system that will help reduce a lot of manual inputs. With this system in place, we can  improve the efficiency of the system, thus overcome the drawbacks of the existing manual system. This system is designed in favour of the hostel management which helps them to save the records of the students about their rooms and other things.

Every organisation whether government or private uses an information system[2.] to store data of their staff. However, in India it is found that many small scale industries use pen and paper to keep a record. However, there are many advanced technology systems available that can do this work but they all are costly for these low level industries. This paper discusses making a system for solving problems for them at a cheaper cost. This system will mark attendance of each employee and calculate the salary of them at the end of month. It also calculates overtime and total working hours of each employee.

Every organisation whether government or private uses an information system[2.] to store data of their staff. However, in India it is found that many small scale industries use pen and paper to keep a record. However, there are many advanced technology systems available that can do this work but they all are costly for these low level industries. This paper discusses making a system for solving problems for them at a cheaper cost. This system will mark attendance of each employee and calculate the salary of them at the end of month. It also calculates overtime and total working hours of each employee. As in small scale each company has their own holidays preference and variable week off for employees, so all this power is given to the employer to manage holidays and week days of each employee separately.

Additionally, manually entering data is time-consuming and therefore, using a management system software, everything is just a click away.
